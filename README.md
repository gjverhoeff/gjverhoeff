Hi, I’m @gjverhoeff

Been working in esports since 2009 on the technical side of broadcast. On my GitHub page I upload some small scripts/concepts for usage in broadcasts (although you probably want to expand the code yourself for your usecase). 

Upload tutorials regulary on https://www.youtube.com/c/GeertVerhoeff and if you want to contact me Twitter DM is the way https://twitter.com/gjverhoeff

Cheers
